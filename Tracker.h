 *    This routine sweeps through all game objects and makes sure that it is no longer         *
 *    referenced by them. Typically, this is called in preparation for the object's death      *
 *    or limbo state.                                                                          *

 *                      answer would be false if the target was actually a stealth             *
 *                      tank that is cloaking. In such a case, the object should be removed    *
 *                      from all non-friendly tracking systems, but otherwise left alone.      *
